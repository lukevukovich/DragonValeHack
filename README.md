# DragonValeHack
Python scripts built to automate DragonVale resource exploits using GameGuardian and Nox emulator.

## How It Works
DragonVale has no server-side checks for resources, so it is possible to manipulate the game client to give you any amount of resources you want.

Game Guardian enables dynamic memory scanning and editing within the emulator. This allows resource values like DragonCash or Gems to be intercepted and changed.

pyautogui simulates mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard inputs on the Nox emulator and Game Guardian window, allowing full automation of the hacking process.
